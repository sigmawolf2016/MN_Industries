             <h2>Rainbow Six Seige</h2>
            <p>
                Rainbow Six Siege, developed by Ubisoft, is a tactical first-person shooter that emphasizes strategy,
                teamwork, and destructible environments. Released in December 2015, the game pits two teams of five
                players against each other, where one team defends and the other attacks. The defending team
                fortifies a
                location with barricades, traps, and reinforcements, while the attacking team uses a range of
                specialized operators and gadgets to breach and secure the objective. Siege's unique blend of strategy,
                realism, and high-stakes gameplay, combined with its evolving roster of operators and maps, has made it
                a standout title in the tactical shooter genre.</p>

            <h2>Valorant</h2>
            <P>
                Valorant is a popular tactical first-person shooter developed by Riot Games, blending precise gunplay
                with unique character abilities. Released in June 2020, it features a roster of Agents, each with their
                own special skills that add layers of strategy to the traditional shooter formula. Set in a
                futuristic
                world, players engage in 5v5 matches where one team attacks and the other defends, with the primary
                objective often revolving around planting or defusing a spike.<br> Valorant’s combination of strategic
                depth, fast-paced action, and vibrant art style has garnered a dedicated following and solidified its
                place in the competitive gaming scene.
